## About Me

As a software engineer and master's student in software engineering at Northeastern University, I am passionate about developing innovative and scalable solutions for complex problems. My coursework covers various topics related to front-end, back-end, and cloud technologies, such as web development, database systems, distributed computing, and software design.

I have two years of professional experience as a software developer at Salesforce, where I worked on multiple projects involving Salesforce CRM, Apex, Visualforce, Lightning, and REST APIs. I also completed a software engineering internship at Resideo, where I developed a browser extension using machine learning and VirusTotal to detect malicious websites and files.

I have strong skills in object-oriented programming, Python, and Salesforce certifications. I am looking for internships or co-ops in the fields of full-stack development or cloud computing, where I can apply my knowledge and skills and learn from industry experts.

### WebSecAsst - A Machine Learning based Chrome Extension
IEEE | Aug 7, 2021

A browser extension, also known as a plugin or an add-on, is a small software application that adds functionality to a web browser. However, security threats are always linked with such software where data can be compromised and ultimately trust is broken. The proposed research work has developed a security model named WebSecAsst, which is a chrome plugin relying on the Machine Learning model XGBoost and VirusTotal to detect malicious websites visited by the user and to detect whether the files downloaded from the internet are Malicious or Safe. During this detection, the proposed model preserves the privacy of the user's data to a greater extent than the existing commercial chrome extensions.
