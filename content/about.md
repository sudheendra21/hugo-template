# Hi there! I'm Alex, a Software Engineer at Northeastern University 👋

I'm a recent graduate from Northeastern University's Khoury College of Computer Sciences, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Data Science. During my time at Northeastern, I had the incredible opportunity to participate in the university's renowned co-op program, which allowed me to gain real-world experience working as a software engineer at several top-tier tech companies.

## My Passion for Technology 💻

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the power of technology to solve complex problems and improve people's lives. This passion led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I can continuously learn and innovate while working on projects that make a meaningful impact.

## My Co-op Experience 🚀

Throughout my time at Northeastern, I completed three six-month co-op placements:

1. **Software Engineering Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: I worked on the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) team, contributing to the development of new features and optimizations for AWS's flagship compute service.

2. **Full Stack Developer at HubSpot**: As part of the Marketing Hub team, I collaborated with designers and product managers to build and maintain user-facing features for HubSpot's marketing automation platform.

3. **Machine Learning Engineer at NVIDIA**: I joined the AI Research team, where I worked on developing and implementing novel deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation.

## My Skills and Interests 🧠

- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Web Development**: React, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS
- **Databases**: SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras
- **Cloud Computing**: AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, Git

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors 🌲, playing soccer with friends ⚽️, or diving into a good science fiction novel 📚.
